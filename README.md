# MS Excel Project — Customer Purchase Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior and bike purchase trends using **Microsoft Excel**. The goal was to transform messy raw data into meaningful insights by applying data cleaning, formulas, Pivot Tables, and an interactive Excel dashboard.

## Project Methodology
- **Raw Data Understanding:** Explored demographic & behavioral fields (gender, marital status, income, commute distance, etc.)
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, standardized values, and applied nested IF logic to categorize age groups.
- **Pivot Table Modeling:** Used Pivot Tables to analyze purchase relationships across multiple attributes.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Built an interactive Excel dashboard using slicers (Gender, Age, Region, Education, etc.) to filter insights instantly.

## Key Learnings
- Transformed raw datasets into structured decision-ready data.
- Strengthened Excel problem-solving through formulas & conditional logic.
- Gained hands-on experience building **interactive business dashboards**.
- Learned how to visually communicate insights that support business strategy.

## Project Insights
- Certain age groups show higher bike purchase probability.
- Commute distance, marital status, and income level influence buying patterns.
- Interactive dashboards make trends easier to understand and compare.

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel (Advanced)
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Slicers & Interactive Dashboard Design
- **Nested IF** logic for categorization
